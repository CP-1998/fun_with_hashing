# Purpose

Hello! I've created this repository to more easily document my learnings of hashing and cryptography. Feel free to suggest any changes to the code, I always welcome criticism.

# Technologies Used

Python, hashlib, random, VSCode, ...

# Application

So far, no projects I'm working on use any hashing, but I'm curious to learn how cryptohraphy works, and eventually hope to dive into using cryptography with blockchain development.
